# Stock Analysis Project


## Purpose of the project
The purpose for this project was to see the growth of stocks in both year 2017 and 2018. So we can decide which stock is worth to invest. We had all the information from before but we just wanted to make an efficient way to look out at our results. That’s why we refactor the code from the original data that we had. 
  
  
## Results
	In general as our original code was too heavy and it takes so long to open up, we refactored the code to see the results in the least possible time. That’s why we make arrays to loop through them and first choose the ticker and then the other parameters that we’re looking for 
and here is my VBA code :

![vba2](/resources/vba2.png)

The results that we got so far was useful for us, as we noticed most of the stocks had significant growth in 2017 comare to 2018 and here is the charts:￼

![2018chart](/resources/2018chart.png)

Also here is the elapsed time to run our refactored code for each year :

![time2018](/resources/time2018.png)


## Advantage & Disadvantage
	By refactoring this code, we made our code to run efficiently but we also know that if we take even short break from a project, it’s gonna be hard to understand and remember what was the purpose of all of our work or we can easily get lost. The other thing that we should be cautious about is if someone else taking care of our project, he/she can easily understand what we did and the code should be readable. We are making our code easy to read and understand for ourselves and others by making comments. In this case for us, refactoring the code was kind of advantage as by running our code we are saving time and the code itself is not heavy. Also, by refactoring it, now it’s so organized and we can easily see the results for 2017 & 2018.
